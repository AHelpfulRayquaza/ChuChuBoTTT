Battle Module:
By no way is this perfected, and it is still a work in progress, and will be updated regularily.

To add a team into it's database, simply do:

    `.addteam [tier], [hastebin]`

It is the person adding the team's duty to make sure the team is valid as the bot will not validate the team.
